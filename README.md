# Connect-4-Game-MVC
first try at game and MVC, created a simple connect 4 game, but with different board (skewed board to make it more fun) which lets you play either in player vs player mode or lets you compete with a computer.

Computer is implemented without min max but it makes brilliant moves.

run the main.java file to play your game.

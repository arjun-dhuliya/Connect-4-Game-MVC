# Connect-4-Game-MVC
first try at game and MVC, created a simple connect 4 game, but with different board (skewed board to make it more fun) which lets you play either in player vs player mode or lets you compete with a computer.

Computer is implemented without min max but it makes brilliant moves.

run the main.java file to play your game.
Use the arrow on the top to play the game.
UI can be buggy on java9; would try to fix it.
